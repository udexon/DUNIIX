# GQ005: How would someone follow up on a GoQ question or answer?

A GoQ entry has a URI or URL.

A commentator may make a comment on his (her) own 
social media account, quoting the original GoQ URI URL.

His comment will then have a URI (URL).

He just need to paste the comment URI somewhere
so that the new comment URI (URI1) can be mapped to the original
 URI (URI0).


# GQ006: How to implement GQ005?

1. Use Python Selenium to create a universal social
media interface, that can post to any social media
and save in Duniix.

2. Need mobile version.

3. Extend existing web phoshell, add DRRT etc.

# GQ008: Label and serial number

2 Latin alphabets plus 3 digits is good for
over 2000 categories and 1000 entries to start with.

The most important effect of numbering is relating the
current item to its previous items.

With GoQ, I can now add new ideas like social 
media postings, very productive, instead of worrying
about essay or article structure.
