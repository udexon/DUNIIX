# GQ005: How would someone follow up on a GoQ question or answer?

A GoQ entry has a URI or URL.

A commentator may make a comment on his (her) own 
social media account, quoting the original GoQ URI URL.

His comment will then have a URI (URL).

He just need to paste the comment URI somewhere
so that the new comment URI (URI1) can be mapped to the original
 URI (URI0).
