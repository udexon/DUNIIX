Traditionally, matchmakers play an important role in Asian societies. As westernization and liberalization grow in Asian societies, Asian IT professionals consciously or subconsciously de-emphasize the role of matchmakers, resulting in the lack of social networking apps with focus on matchmakers.

Prior to the COVID19 pandemic, Asian economies have been growing rapidly that matchmaking was not an issue of concern. In the pandemic stricken 2021 however, matchmaking has unexpectedly become a life saving profession, as its nature is one of those that will help societies overcome times of difficulties. However, of course, this goes against the westernization and liberalization agenda and will be condemned by certain lobbyists.

Dateniix is based on a fundamental Duniix module called Duniix Recommendation Omni Incentive Tokens (DROIT), where Party A (Recommender) makes a recommendation to Party B (Referral) using RSA-DSC (decentralized sign and cipher) algorithm.

Duniix is a novel web and mobile application development framework based on the philosophies of Decentralization and User Centric, hence the prefix DU, together with the suffix NIIX derived from Unix.
