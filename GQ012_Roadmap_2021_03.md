# GQ012 Roadmap 2021-03

1. We suppose over the years, there have been many individuals
who have ideas on improving the web, but were not able to
secure the resources needed to implement them.

One of the biggest obstacles would be the lack of effective tools
to share ideas, or such ideas were too complex to describe to fellow
programmers.

We hope that our solution may finally solve the problems above:

- [Graph of Questions](https://github.com/udexon/DUNIIX/blob/main/DU003_Linked_Comments.md)

2. We hope that GoQ will help us communicates with readers more effectively, by
publishing Duniix project notes and training material faster, by avoiding 
the conventional essay / article formats.

Users may also adopt GoQ to help communicate with their readers.

3. We have now demonstrated the use case of GoQ as you are reading.

Next, we hope to recruit collaborators so that we may have more
manpower to develop GoQ and Duniix into a full fledged web service,
which we may call W++ or Web++, to signify the breakthrough
it may bring.

- add Duniix link to explain 4 elements

# GQ014: LSLVL Learn a Second Language by Video Blogging

1. Douyin (China Tiktok) videos of blind students in Guizhou practising English.

2. LSLVL is one those very rare "such a wonderful yet simple, but no one has done it" idea:

- Instead of getting one teacher to make 100 videos to describe basic vocabularies in a second language, getting 100 students each to make 1 video to explain basic vocabularies, is more viable and interesting.
- 1 x 100 < 100 x 1 !!


3. One or more students, under the guidance of a teacher or tutor, make a short video, to demonstrate the usage and explanation of one or two new words, with one or two sentences.

- When a large number of such videos are made, we will create a "video dictionary" for a particular pair of languages (e.g. English-Chinese), with Duniix search engine.

- This will perhaps solve the hardest problem in learning a second language: lack of a complete, word by word, online video dictionary (with visuals and audio), for students to learn word by word.

- By engaging students to volunteer on making such video dictionaries (sponsorships are possible), we would have enough manpower to make video dictionaries for all possible language pairs in the world, covering every word in every language!!


4. LSLVL is only the beginning of a series of online training programs that we have planned with Duniix and FSBR (Free Software Business Revolution). We plan to expand the training contents to cover other subjects and disciplines, such as cooking, videography, programming and so on.

We shall promote the fundamental philosophy of free software in these online training programs, which is unique compared to other conventional training programs.


5. LSLVL will be able to engage a large number of students, of various levels of proficiency, from various backgrounds and ages, in many countries. They can become significant political forces, as they acquire novel understanding of the free software philosophy, as applied in business and politics.



# GQ015: Implement LSLVL with Duniix
