# GQ012 Roadmap 2021-03

1. We suppose over the years, there have been many individuals
who have ideas on improving the web, but were not able to
secure the resources needed to implement them.

One of the biggest obstacles would be the lack of effective tools
to share ideas, or such ideas were too complex to describe to fellow
programmers.

We hope that our solution may finally solve the problems above:

- [Graph of Questions](https://github.com/udexon/DUNIIX/blob/main/DU003_Linked_Comments.md)

2. We hope that GoQ will help us communicates with readers more effectively, by
publishing Duniix project notes and training material faster, by avoiding 
the conventional essay / article formats.

Users may also adopt GoQ to help communicate with their readers.

3. We have now demonstrated the use case of GoQ as you are reading.

Next, we hope to recruit collaborators so that we may have more
manpower to develop GoQ and Duniix into a full fledged web service,
which we may call W++ or Web++, to signify the breakthrough
it may bring.

- add Duniix link to explain 4 elements
