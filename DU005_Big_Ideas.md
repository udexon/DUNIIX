# Big Ideas & Small Actions

Some big ideas in life begins with small actions.

A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.

- [DU004](https://github.com/udexon/DUNIIX/blob/main/DU004_Modify_HTML.md) demonstrates a small step of modifying a DOM element in a web page.

### GQ002: What big ideas can DU004 lead to? 

This question also demonstrates the mechanisms of GoQ: multiple threads can be created to mapped multiple questions, from various perspectives, to one answer.

1. Duniix Recommendation Reward Token (DRRT)

Modify DOM --> create own web page --> DRRT --> Recommend to Others --> Increase Exposures and Sales

DRRT = biggest DUAS app, revolutionize CUAS web

- link to DRRT


2. GoQ / CLC provides an open mechanism and platform to promote (like, upvote, downvote, etc.) or process (follow up, extract, modify, quantify, etc.) comments made in any social network or platform (or any object addressable with URI, including comments).

- GoQ and CLC are two slightly different names describing similar concepts. Need to clarify / unify ??


## GQ003: What is the most important reason for using GoQ / CLC / URJ ?

3. Social media growth demonstrate that people talk (short comments) more than write essay (long articles). GoQ / CLC are mechanisms to link these comments or URJ (Uniform Resource JSON, a generic data structure to represent GoQ, CLC, etc.) so that everyone can have a better way to re-presenting (presenting again) comments that he (she) made yesterday (in the past), because repeat presenting is very important to new target audience, by modifying the context, but still need to easily link to the past comments using URJ.



#### 4. GoQ, CLC and URJ are closely related. Need to clarify and unify.

This is like FAQ. But usually FAQ is made for smaller project scope and with more team members. Duniix is short of man power and the scope is huge.

GoQ implies how our brain process information. A comment is usually an answer, with an implicit question, not shown on social media, because the parties concerned (A and B) understand the context.

GoQ provides an open ended way to describe a project, from multiple perspectives, for multiple audience.

Need to link GoQ, modify DOM to other components and elements of Duniix.
