# DUNIIX
DUNIIX: Decentralized User Centric Interface

We coined the name DUNIIX to highlight the Decentralized nature of DUNIIX, in contrast to the centralized systems inherited from UNIX.

DUNIIX is also very different from Blockchains as we are "User Centric", hence the "U" in DUNIIX.

The double I is used to avoid conflicts with existing DUNIX entities, as well as to signify II &mdash; the Roman Numeral 2 &mdash; for a new generation.

Finally IIX in Roman Numerals is 8, a lucky number in Chinese.
