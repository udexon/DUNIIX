# DU003: Comments Linking Comments

The World Wide Web is basically a page linking page (PLP) network. After decades of development, social media comments and actions (SMCA) (likes, upvotes, downvotes, etc.) have perhaps (because no available systematic surveys) surpassed web pages as the most popular media of communications amongst users.

However, as all comments are linked to post and managed by a sole proprietor --- the owner of the web page or app, it has been troublesome and unprofitable to develop a "comments linking comments" (CLC) mechanism similar to "page linking page" (PLP).

Why no one can do comment linking comment (CLC)? Because there has been no open platform for publishing comments. 
Even if there is a CLC (comment linking comment) protocol, there is no commercial incentive to do so --- unless coupled with Duniix DUAS Recommendation Reward. Users may earn a reward â€¦.
