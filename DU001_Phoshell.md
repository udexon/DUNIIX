# DUNIIX Phoshell: A Metaprogramming Shell

In [DUDE: Decentralized User Centric Donation Scheme](https://github.com/udexon/DUDE/blob/main/README.md), we highlighted that:

- _NO free software programmer since Richard Stallman has been able to create a universal donation scheme to allow free software programmers to receive donations in small amounts from arbitrary donors._

  - In this video, we show DUNIIX Messaging module (DUMES).

2. https://github.com/udexon/DUNIIX/blob/main/img/DUNIIX-DUCT.mp4
  - In this video, we show DUNIIX Decentralized User Contract Token DUCT.

(2) was implemented and tested with 2 web clients and the DUDE PHP server, all running on one Linux host.

In practice, DUDE needs to be hosted on a server with public IP or via a SSH tunnel.

There is another way that DUDE can be hosted in an "offline" mode, as illustrated below.

1. Mr. Udexon (owner of this github account) published his (her) public key in a file on github:

2. Mr. Anyone (or Someone) wishes to donate USD 10 to Udexon.

3. A (Mr. Anyone) downloads Udexon PBK, generates DUCT token.

4. A uploads DUCT token to the Issues section on Udexon github repository.
5. As DUNIIX is an ongoing project, additional modules need to be developed after DUCT tokens are generated and exchanged amongst various parties concernedï¼š
- i. DUCT is a _decentralized cryptographically binding promise between 2 parties_. This is a novel and unprecedented entity from both legal and technical perspectives. It is analogous to signatures on physical paper in legal documents. However, a complete physical payment transaction involve more steps and multiple parties. DUCT can be generated and applied for each of these steps and parties involved. As such additional DUNIIX modules need to be developed to implement these steps for a complete transaction.
- ii. DUDE and other DUNIIX modules and apps can be developed and deployed in various operating systems (web, Android, iOS, etc).
- iii. DUCloud (DUNIIX cloud): DUDE and other DUNIIX modules and apps can be deployed in offline, SSH tunnel, and fixed public IP mode.

This article describes the development of some of the additional DUNIIX modules required to complete a DUDE transaction. We introduce Phoshell, a very light weight metaprogramming shell environment that is embeddable as a function in any known programming language or application platform, based on Phoscript, which in turn is derived and inspired by the Forth programming language.

The following screenshots illustrate how a Donor Mr. Anyone may _make a cryptographically binding promise_ to donate USD 10 to Mr. Udexon, the owner of this GitHub account:

- Figure 1: Mr. Anyone uses DUNIIX DUDE web client and DUNIIX Phoshell (backgroup Python terminal) to generate DUCT (Decentralized User Contract Token) (see figure 2).
