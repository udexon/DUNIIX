# DUNIIX Phoshell: A Metaprogramming Shell

In [DUDE: Decentralized User Centric Donation Scheme](https://github.com/udexon/DUDE/blob/main/README.md), we highlighted that:

- _NO free software programmer since Richard Stallman has been able to create a universal donation scheme to allow free software programmers to receive donations in small amounts from arbitrary donors._

  - In this video, we show DUNIIX Messaging module (DUMES).

2. https://github.com/udexon/DUNIIX/blob/main/img/DUNIIX-DUCT.mp4
  - In this video, we show DUNIIX Decentralized User Contract Token DUCT.

(2) was implemented and tested with 2 web clients and the DUDE PHP server, all running on one Linux host.

In practice, DUDE needs to be hosted on a server with public IP or via a SSH tunnel.


The following screenshots illustrate how a Donor Mr. Anyone may _make a cryptographically binding promise_ to donate USD 10 to Mr. Udexon, the owner of this GitHub account:

- Figure 1: Mr. Anyone uses DUNIIX DUDE web client and DUNIIX Phoshell (backgroup Python terminal) to generate DUCT (Decentralized User Contract Token) (see figure 2).
